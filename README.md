# README

This repository contains the Unity project files. If you want to play the game, you can do so on Itch.io using [this link](https://owengretz.itch.io/smile). I made it while completing the [Unity Junior Programmer course](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer), for which you can find my certification [here](https://www.credly.com/badges/d8d2a3af-bf72-4009-9ac0-1147b1be9334?source=linked_in_profile).
